    """
    Admin class for models that subclass the abstract ``Ownable``
    model. Handles limiting the change list to objects owned by the
    logged in user, as well as setting the owner of newly created
    objects to the logged in user.
    Remember that this will include the ``user`` field in the required
    fields for the admin change form which may not be desirable. The
    best approach to solve this is to define a ``fieldsets`` attribute
    that excludes the ``user`` field or simple add ``user`` to your
    admin excludes: ``exclude = ('user',)``
